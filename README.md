# Read Texture Data

In this tutorial repostiory you'll learn how to sample a 2D texture and get a weighted randomness value based on an arbitrary color attribute. We're using grayScale value in this specific example, but any r/g/b/a or grayScale can be used.

You will understand how to read texture data at a specific pixel (or group of pixels) and map those back to the coordinate on the texture that you sampled.

In our example here, we sample a progressively larger area over time.
